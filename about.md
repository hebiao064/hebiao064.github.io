Hello,

My name is **Biao He**, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems. I'm currently working on the AI Platform team at LinkedIn, where I'm responsible for building the training infrastructure that powers the company's machine learning models.

I'm also an open source enthusiast and have contributed to several projects, including [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), [Liger-Kernel](https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel) and [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

You can find more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biao-he/) or [X](https://x.com/hebiao064).
